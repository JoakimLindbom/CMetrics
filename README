C metrics package
=================

INSTALL
-------

see INSTALL file

USAGE
-----

cmetrics [-h] [-f] [-p] [-n] target_dir

positional arguments:
  target_dir       directory with sources (recursively scanned)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -f, --functions  show metrics for functions instead of files
  -p, --path       show full file path in the last column
  -n, --no-header  do not show metrics names in the first row
	  

HOW TO INTERPRET THE OUTPUT OF CMETRICS
---------------------------------------

CMetrics measures size and complexity for C files. The metrics are the
following:

 SLOC    Source Lines of Code (text lines excluding blanks and
         comments)
 LOC	 Text lines in the source code file (including blanks, etc)
 BLANK	 Number of blank lines
 COM.L	 Number of lines that are exclusively comments (no code)
 COM.N	 Number of comments in the file (a comment can be multiline)
 H.LEN	 Halstead's Length
 H.VOL	 Halstead's Volume
 H.LEVEL Halstead's Level
 H MEN.D Halstead's number of mental discriminations
 MAXCY	 Maximum McCabe's cyclomatic complexity (between all the
         functions)
 MINCY	 Minimum McCabe's cyclomatic complexity
 AVGCY	 Average McCabe's cyclomatic complexity
 MEDCY	 Median McCabe's cyclomatic complexity
 TOTCY	 Total McCabe's cyclomatic complexity (sum of all functions)

If you use the '-f' option, you will get info for functions instead of
files. If the function name is "***", it means that it is code outside
of the scope of functions but inside the file. The available metrics
are:

 SLOC    Source Lines of code
 CYCLO	 McCabe's cyclomatic complexity
 RETURN	 Number of exit points in the function
