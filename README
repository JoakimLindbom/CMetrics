What tools are included in this package?
========================================

mccabe ------ Measures cyclomatic's complexity and number of function
returns for a given C file.  It returns the values at the level of
function (this is a value per function).

It uses stripstr to remove strings from the C file.  It uses stripcom
to remove comments from the C file.

kdsi ----

Measures SLOC, number of blank lines, number of comment lines and
number of comments for a C file.

The output is the above metrics, in that order, at a file level (this
is, a set of values per file).

halstead --------

Masures Halstead's length, volumen, level and mental discriminations
for a C file.

The output is the above metrics, in that order, at a file level (this
is, a set of values per file).

Other utilities ---------------

stripcom to remove the comments of a C file stripstr to remove the
strings of a C file

With these two utilities and indent you can generate "clean" C code
(this is, only code, with the same indentation style, etc).
